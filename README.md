Advanced Navigation Support for SwiftUI.

## Introduction

Navigator provides SwiftUI with a simple yet powerful navigation layer based on NavigationStack. 

It supports...

* Simple and easy navigation linking and presentation of views.
* Coordination patterns with well-defined separation of concerns. 
* External deep linking and internal application navigation via navigation send.
* Easily returning to a specific spot in the navigation tree via navigation checkpoints.
* Returning callback values via navigation checkpoints.
* Both Declarative and Imperative navigation and control.
* Navigation state restoration.
* Event logging and debugging.

Navigator is written entirely in Swift and SwiftUI, and supports iOS 16 and above.

## The Code

### Defining Navigation Destinations
Destinations (or routes) are typically just public lists of enumerated values, one for each view desired.
```swift
public enum HomeDestinations {
    case page2
    case page3
    case pageN(Int)
}
```
SwiftUI requires navigation destination values to be `Hashable`, and so do we.

Next, we extend each destination with a variable that returns the correct view for each case.
```swift
extension HomeDestinations: NavigationDestination {
    public var view: some View {
        switch self {
        case .page2:
            HomePage2View()
        case .page3:
            HomePage3View()
        case .pageN(let value):
            HomePageNView(number: value)
        }
    }
}
```
Note how associated values can be used to pass parameters to views as needed.

*To build views that have external dependencies or that require access to environmental values, see ``Advanced Destinations`` below.*

### Registering Navigation Destinations
Like traditional `NavigationStack` destination types, `NavigationDestination` types need to be registered with the enclosing
navigation stack in order for `navigate(to:)` presentations and standard `NavigationLink(value:label:)` transitions 
to work correctly.

But since each `NavigationDestination` already defines the views to be provided, registering destination types can be done
using a simple one-line view modifier.
```swift
ManagedNavigationStack {
    HomeView()
        .navigationDestination(HomeDestinations.self)
}
```
This also makes using the same destination type with more than one navigation stack a lot easier.

### Using Navigation Destinations
With that out of the way, Navigation Destinations can be dispatched using a standard SwiftUI `NavigationLink(value:label:)` view.
```swift
NavigationLink(value: HomeDestinations.page3) {
    Text("Link to Home Page 3!")
}
```
Or they can be dispatched declaratively using modifiers.
```swift
// Sample using optional destination
@State var page: SettingsDestinations?
...
Button("Modifier Navigate to Page 3!") {
    page = .page3
}
.navigate(to: $page)

// Sample using trigger value
@State var triggerPage3: Bool = false
...
Button("Modifier Trigger Page 3!") {
    triggerPage3.toggle()
}
.navigate(trigger: $triggerPage3, destination: SettingsDestinations.page3)
```
Or imperatively by asking a Navigator to perform the desired action.
```swift
@Environment(\.navigator) var navigator: Navigator
...
Button("Button Push Home Page 55") {
    navigator.push(HomeDestinations.pageN(55))
}
Button("Button Navigate To Home Page 55") {
    navigator.navigate(to: HomeDestinations.pageN(55))
}
```
In case you're wondering, calling `push` pushes the associate view onto the current `NavigationStack`, while `Navigate(to:)` will push
the view or present the view, based on the `NavigationMethod` specified (coming up next).

### Navigation Methods

`NavigationDestination` can be extended to provide a distinct ``NavigationMethod`` for each enumerated type.
```swift
extension HomeDestinations: NavigationDestination {
    public var method: NavigationMethod {
        switch self {
        case .page3:
            .sheet
        default:
            .push
        }
    }
}
```
In this case, should `navigator.navigate(to: HomeDestinations.page3)` be called, Navigator will automatically present that view in a
sheet. All other views will be pushed onto the navigation stack.

The current navigation methods are: .push (default), .sheet, .cover, and .send.

Predefined methods can be overridden using Navigator's `navigate(to:method:)` function.

```swift
Button("Present Home Page 55 Via Sheet") {
    navigator.navigate(to: HomeDestinations.pageN(55), method: .sheet)
}
```
*Note that destinations dispatched via NavigationLink will always push onto the NavigationStack. That's just how SwiftUI works.*

### Checkpoints

While one can programmatically pop and dismiss their way out of a screen, that approach is problematic and fragile. One could pass bindings down the tree, but that can be equally problematic at worst, and cumbersome at best.

Fortunately, Navigator supports checkpoints; named points in the navigation stack to which one can easily return.

Checkpoints are easy to define and use. Let's create one called "home" and then use it.
```swift
extension NavigationCheckpoint {
    public static let home: NavigationCheckpoint = "home"
}

struct RootHomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ManagedNavigationStack(scene: "home") {
            HomeContentView(title: "Home Navigation")
                .navigationCheckpoint(.home)
                .navigationDestination(HomeDestinations.self)
        }
    }
}
```
Once defined, they're easy to use.
```swift
Button("Return To Checkpoint Home") {
    navigator.returnToCheckpoint(.home)
}
.disabled(!navigator.canReturnToCheckpoint(.home))
```
When fired, checkpoints will dismiss any presented screens and pop any pushed views to return exactly where desired.

Checkpoints can also be used to return values to a caller.
```swift
// Define a checkpoint with a value handler.
.navigationCheckpoint(.settings) { (result: Int?) in
    returnValue = result
}

// Return, passing a value.
Button("Return to Settings Checkpoint Passing Value 5") {
    navigator.returnToCheckpoint(.settings, value: 5)
}
```
Checkpoints are a powerful tool. Use them.

### Deep Linking Support

Navigator supports external deep linking and internal application navigation via navigation send.

This comes in handy when navigation means needing to change non-NavigationStack-based values like the selected tab, or perhaps an account number used to trigger the detail view in a `NavigationSplitView`.

Consider the following fairly standard RootTabView.
```swift
struct RootTabView : View {
    @SceneStorage("selectedTab") var selectedTab: RootTabs = .home
    var body: some View {
        TabView(selection: $selectedTab) {
            RootHomeView()
                .tabItem { Label("Home", systemImage: "house") }
                .tag(RootTabs.home)
            RootSettingsView()
                .tabItem { Label("Settings", systemImage: "gear") }
                .tag(RootTabs.settings)
        }
        .onNavigationReceive { (tab: RootTabs, navigator) in
            try? navigator.dismissAny()
            selectedTab = tab
            return .auto
        }
    }
}
```
Sharp eyes may have spotted the `onNavigationReceive` modifier, which--much like `navigationDestination(MyType.self)`--is listening for Navigator to broadcast a value of type RootTabs.

When received, Navigator will dismiss any presented screens, set the selected tab, and then return normally.

Values are broadcast using `navigationSend()` or `navigationSend(values:)`, as shown below.
```swift
Button("Send Tab Home, Page 2") {
    navigator.send(values: [
        RootTabs.home,
        HomeDestinations.page2
    ])
}
```
The `RootTabs` receiver switches to the selected tab, and then a similar `HomeDestinations` receiver sends the user to page 2.
```swift
.onNavigationReceive { (destination: HomeDestinations, navigator) in
    navigator.navigate(to: destination)
    return .auto
}
```
This mechanism makes deep linking and internal navigation support simple and easy.

### Advanced Destinations

What if we can't construct a specific view without external dependencies or without accessing the environment? 

Simple. Just delegate the view building to a standard SwiftUI view!
```swift
extension HomeDestinations: NavigationDestination {
    public var view: some View {
        HomeDestinationsView(destination: self)
    }
}

private struct HomeDestinationsView: View {
    let destination: HomeDestinations
    @Environment(\.coreDependencies) var resolver
    var body: some View {
        switch self {
        case .home:
            HomePageView(viewModel: HomePageViewModel(dependencies: resolver))
        case .page2:
            HomePage2View(viewModel: HomePage2ViewModel(dependencies: resolver))
        case .page3:
            HomePage3View(viewModel: HomePage3ViewModel(dependencies: resolver))
        case .pageN(let value):
            HomePageNView(viewModel: HomePageNViewModel(dependencies: resolver), number: value)
        }
    }
}
```
In the above code, we obtain a `coreDependencies` resolver from the environment, and then use it to construct our views
and view models.

Note this technique can be used to construct and use fully functional views elsewhere in your view code. Consider.
```swift
struct RootHomeView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ManagedNavigationStack(scene: "home") {
            HomeDestinations.home()
                .navigationDestination(HomeDestinations.self)
        }
    }
}
```
Calling the destination as a function obtains a fully resolved `HomePageView` and view model from `HomeDestinationsView`, 
complete and ready to go.

See the 'DemoDependency.swift' file in the NavigatorDemo project for a possible dependency injection mechanism.
