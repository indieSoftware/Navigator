# ``NavigatorUI``

Managed NavigationStacks for SwiftUI.

## Introduction

Navigator provides SwiftUI with a simple yet powerful navigation layer based on NavigationStack. 

It supports...

* Simple and easy navigation linking and presentation of views.
* Coordination patterns with well-defined separation of concerns. 
* External deep linking and internal application navigation via navigation send.
* Easily returning to a specific spot in the navigation tree via navigation checkpoints.
* Returning callback values via navigation checkpoints.
* Both Declarative and Imperative navigation and control.
* Navigation state restoration.
* Event logging and debugging.
* No navigationDestination registration operations are required.

You might want to reread that last bullet point again...

Navigator is written entirely in Swift and SwiftUI, and supports iOS 16 and above.
